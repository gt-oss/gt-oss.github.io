### Current Projects

Our Projects highlight the innovative and cutting-edge work being done by the Open Source Software Club at Georgia Tech. Here you can explore the various projects our members are currently working on, ranging from web development to machine learning, and everything in between.

Each project is accompanied by a brief description and the names of the team members working on it. You can also find links to the project's GitHub repository or website, where you can learn more about the project's goals and progress.

We take pride in fostering an environment where members can work collaboratively and gain hands-on experience with real-world software development projects. Our Projects showcase the diverse skill sets and interests of our members, as well as the club's dedication to advancing open source software development.
